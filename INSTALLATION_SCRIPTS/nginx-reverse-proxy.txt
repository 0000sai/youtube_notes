Create a new server block configuration file for Nginx:


sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/jenkins
Inside the text editor, paste the following configuration:


server {
    listen 80;
    server_name ur Dns name;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
Save and close the file (in nano, press Ctrl+O, then Enter, and Ctrl+X to exit).

Enable the server block by creating a symbolic link in the sites-enabled directory:


sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/jenkins /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
Verify the Nginx configuration:

Copy code
sudo nginx -t
If the configuration test is successful, restart Nginx for the changes to take effect:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Update the DNS settings for your domain (mrcloudbook.online) in your Hostinger account to point to the IP address of your server.

Wait for the DNS changes to propagate (typically a few minutes to a few hours, depending on various factors).

Access your Jenkins server using the URL http://ur dns name.

That's it! You have successfully set up an Nginx reverse proxy for your Jenkins server using your Hostinger DNS name. Now you can access Jenkins securely through your domain.
